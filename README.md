Simple Clock Widget for Android.
This is a project that implements simple resizable widget that shows a digital clock on a translucent background. 
You can change text color and size on a whim. Single tap on the widget opens the standard alarm application. 
Double click is used to call the widget configuration utility.
The widget uses service to update displayed time every second. 
Sometimes Android deprives the application of the CPU, so the clock can halt for some seconds.
